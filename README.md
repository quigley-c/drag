# Tactical Draft Random Generator
TDRG was inspired by "Drafts" which are commonly done in some games where players
will draft the cast of playable characters. Drafted characters are then the only
characters that are usable during the playthrough.

For example: There are four people who want to play through a fun Fire Emblem:
Sacred Stones draft. A regular draft, when completed, might look like this:

![tierlist draft](./sample-list.png "list")

(note: Image for example purposes only, tool does not generate image.)

There isn't a lot of time and/or the four people don't
want to sit through a whole draft session so they use TDRG to generate the
teams for them. TDRG takes text files with the games' roster as input. The
group of drafters picks the FE8.txt file, recieves their teams, and is
ready to play in seconds!

The end goal for TDRG is to have as many games as possible available to
streamline the process of getting into a draft. If you make a text file for a
game that TDRG doesn't already have, I strongly urge you to [contribute](
