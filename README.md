# Tactical Draft Random Generator
TDRG was inspired by "Drafts" which are commonly done in some games where players
will draft the cast of playable characters. Drafted characters are then the only
characters that are usable during the playthrough.

For example: There are four people who want to play through a fun Fire Emblem:
Sacred Stones draft. A regular draft, when completed, might look like this:

![tierlist draft](./sample-list.png "list")

(note: Image for example purposes only, tool does not generate image.)

There isn't a lot of time and/or the four people don't
want to sit through a whole draft session so they use TDRG to generate the
teams for them. TDRG takes a text file as input, and has some games' rosters
pre-defined. The group of drafters picks the FE8.txt file, recieves their teams,
and is ready to play in seconds!
